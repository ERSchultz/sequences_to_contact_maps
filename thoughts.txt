-diffusion map on 100s of bulk hic datasets to see variation accross cell types
--could combine with gene expression to find structural patterns that predict gene expression

-can we do something interesting with higher-order chromatin interactions?
--does our model reproduce this? - even though hic only contains pairwise interactions?

-TADS:
--hybrid MC-MD for TADs??
--can we do TADs in TICG in 'unsupervised' manner (i.e. requiring only hic data)?
---e.g. use TAD caller and define start and end as those loci
--does a TICG simulation with only diagonal effect show TAD-like patterns for single frames??
---look at pairwise spatial distance matrix
---if using a term like Bin Zhang CTCF, if you delete term 3 do you see weaker TAD boundaries????

Finite size effect:
2) I think this result is more of a commentary on the parameters of our model than of the biological implications. This means that we can’t take parameters used to simulate a given amount of DNA and re-use them to simulate a longer stretch of DNA. Therefore, our parameters aren’t thermodynamically meaningful, but that’s ok because we don’t care about the thermodynamic meaning of the diagonal parameters. 3) If we scale up to simulate entire chromosomes, the deviation is no longer an artifact - it's a result. 4) With large simulations, the interactions at longer distance will become increasingly rare and are generally less interesting. So simulation artifacts aren’t as concerning.
